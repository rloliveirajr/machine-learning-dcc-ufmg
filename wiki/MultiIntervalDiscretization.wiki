This is an implementation of the algorithm presented in the paper:

[http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/handle/2014/35171 Fayyad, Usama M.; Irani, Keki B. (1993) "Multi-Interval Discretization of Continuous-Valued Attributes for Classification Learning". hdl:2014/35171. , Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Uncertainty in AI (Q334 .I571 1993), pp. 1022-1027]

Discretization refers to the process of converting or partitioning continuous attributes, features or variables to discretized or nominal attributes/features/variables/intervals. 
We used this algorithm, because our associative algorithm only works with discretized attributes.

To compile the file type make. In the folder input the are two files to test the implementation. To run the test type make run. To see an explanation of the program's argument type make help.
